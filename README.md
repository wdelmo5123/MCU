MCU Website by William Delmo

A website with upcoming movies and shows from the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also has the current and former roster of the Avengers. It has a contact form that sends the user to a thank-you page that refreshes after 5 seconds. It also has a table displaying the top 5 highest grossing Marvel movies. It also has a form about the user's favorite Marvel hero. Within the console, it shows a counter of how many each option was selected.
